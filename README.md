This is my solution to the "Music Time Machine" challenge from _Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp_, from the London 
App Brewery.

## What do I need to run this?

1. **Python installed**
2. **A Spotify Account**
3. **To create your own Spotify App at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**
   4. (This repository code will be your App)
5. **Your own Spotify CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and REDIRECT_URI**
   6. (You will copy the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from your App in the Developer Dashboard - _Spotify will give 
      you this_)
   7. (You will set your REDIRECT_URI in your App in the Developer Dashboard - _you will give this to Spotify_)
8. **To set your ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES in your Operating System (OS)**
   9. (Your environment varibles are... your CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and the chosen REDIRECT_URI)
   10. (This is a security measure. You don't want your credentials available to public.)
11. **Select a valid date in time**
    12. (YYYY-MM-DD = YEAR-MONTH-DAY)
